## Reverse a LinkedList
1. simple question

## Find the middle of LinkedList
1. concept is slow and fast pointer

## Merge two sorted Linked List
1. (use method used in mergeSort)

## Remove N-th node from back of LinkedList
1. forward-backword =n

## Find intersection point of Y LinkedList
1. forward-backword = (len_of_large_ll - len_of_small_ll) 

## Floyd’s Cycle Detection
1. slow and fast

## Palindrome Linked List
1. slow and fast

## Reverse a LinkedList in groups of size k.
1. Logic

## Find the starting point of the Loop of LinkedList
1. slow fast and the calculation of length see the takeuforword solution 

## Flattening of a LinkedList
1. logic
